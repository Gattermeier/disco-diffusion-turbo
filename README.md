This is the Turbo edition of Disco Diffusion v5.0, which improves intra-frame coherence for 3D animations, with faster batch renders of animations.  It also contains a couple of additional color management features not found in Disco Diffusion.

### Version 5.1 of Disco Diffusion now includes the Turbo 3d animation features. ðŸš€
